2. Installing the desktop app (Windows or Mac). [Download here](https://github.com/budgetzero/budgetzero/releases/latest)
3. Self host the web app. You can either deploy the docker image or build and host the static files on your own webserver. See deployment section below for more details. 

# :warning: Known Issues (being worked on)
- UI Inconsistencies (pop-up boxes, colors, etc)
- Performance not tested for extremely large budgets (thousands of transactions)
- Transfer transactions work but may be a bit buggy
- Find a bug? Please [file an issue!](../../issues)

# Deployment
## Docker 
```
docker pull budgetzero/budgetzero:latest
```
Then run with 
```
docker run -d -p <desired_port>:8080 --name budgetzero budgetzero/budgetzero
```
Example:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name budgetzero budgetzero/budgetzero
```
Your budgetzero instance is now running at <docker_IP>:<desired_port>

## Manual Deployment
You can also build the static files and host on any webserver.
```
npm install
npm run build
```
The files will be built into the dist/ folder and can be hosted anywhere.

## Sync Server Setup
Budgetzero uses [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) to store the all data client-side in the browser. In order to enable sync across multiple browsers and/or devices, you'll need to set up a [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) server accessible from the desired devices. This setup guide is a general overview, feel free to adapt as needed.

  <summary markdown="span">Manual Setup Instructions for Advanced Users</summary>  
  </br>  

1. Install CouchDB on a server: [Manually](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html) or with the [official docker couchdb](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-docker) image.  
  If you're using docker, start CouchDB using the provided instructions.  
  Example:  
    ```
    docker run -d --name budgetzero-couchdb-sync -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password couchdb:latest
    ```
    Replace <code>admin</code> and <code>password</code> with desired user/password.  

2. Navigate to http://[docker_host_IP]:5984/_utils, which opens the Fauxton web interface for CouchDB administration. 

4. Go to 'Configuration' and enable CORS for all domains.  
5. Create a database with whatever name you desire.
6. In BudgetZero, go to Settings and set the couchdb URL to start syncing. This will need to be set up for each client/browser/computer/etc.  
   Examples:  
   ```http://localhost:5984/mybudget```  
   ```http://username:password@192.168.1.10:5984/mybudget```

# Development
## Pull Requests

Good pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are a greatly appreciated.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise, you risk spending a lot of time working on something that might not get accepted or is already in development.

## Dev Setup
```
npm install
```

### To start a development web server:
```
npm run dev
```

### Preview production server
```
npm run serve
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Run tests
Run all tests once:
```
npm run test:unit
```

Run all tests and re-run if files change:  
```
npm run test-watch:unit
```

Run with debugger (chrome://inspect)
```
node --inspect node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand tests/unit/Transactions.spec.js    
```
